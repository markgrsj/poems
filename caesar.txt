Soliloquy of Marc Anthony
-------------------------

O pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
Who ever livEd in the tide of times
woe to hands that shed this costly blood
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy
Which like dumb mouths do open their Ruby lips
And beg the voice and utterance of my tongue
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men
Domestic fury and firce civil strife
Shall cumber all the parts of Italy
Blood and destruction shall be so in use
That mothers shall but smile when they behold
Their infants quarter'd by the hands of war
That parenting skills will suffer
All pity choked with custom of fell deeds
Then Caesar's spirit, raging with revenge
Ate keeping caesar company
