Letter that Gandalf wrote to Frodo
----------------------------------

All that is gold does not glitter
Not all those who wander are lost
The old that is strong does not wither
Deep Roots are not harmed by the frost

From the ashes a fire shall be woken
A light from the shadows shall spring;
Renewed shall be blade that was broken
The crownless somethings
